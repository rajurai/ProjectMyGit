# Overview

Alliance is a Software Defined Gateway for inter-cloud integration, which stitches together multiple distinct clouds to support many  hybrid cloud delivery profiles. In other worlds, Alliance gateway is a de-centralized application (DApp) component which enables peer-to-peer (P2P) inter-cloud integration to support many hybrid cloud profiles, e.g. enterprise private cloud to provider cloud bursting, virtual private cloud (VPC) and Intercloud provider collaboration.

## Hybrid cloud models

Alliance framework support following hybrid cloud delivery models.

![Hybrid Cloud Models](docs/_static/HybridCloudModels.png)

### Model 1

In this model, a private cloud or VPC consumes resources from shared pool from provider cloud. There is no resource isolation and capacity guarantee. 

### Model 2

In this model, a private cloud or VPC consumes resources from dedicated resource pool (physical resources) from provider cloud. It provide resource isolation and capacity guarantee. In some cases a provider offers "Cloud As A Service" to back on-prem private cloud or VPC.   

## Features

The main design goals of Allaince is to integrate infrastructure (IaaS) and platform (PaaS) cloud capabilities to provide a uniform interoperable platform. Alliance currently supports OpenStack cloud platform but it follows platform agnostic pluggable modular design, that means underpinning cloud platform can be different. Following are the specific features 

* Single pane of glass for Intercloud.
    * Single endpoint and uniform set of APIs to manage resources across many distinct clouds.   
    * Resource management lookup/provisioning/de-provisioning (IaaS) across clouds.
    * Orchestration. (Integration with HOT)
    * Intercloud OSS and BSS support.
* Moduler and Pluggable framework.
    * Platform agnostic integration.
* PKI Trust based integration.
    * Cryptographic (ACS 256) secured communication.
    * Full mesh federation.
    * Anonymization
* Namespaces and Project Federation
    * Keep project name same everywhere.  
* Native Federation
    * Seamless token operations (SSO).
    * Intercloud Authentication
    * Intercloud meter synchronization and aggregation.
* Distributed Quota enforcement.

## Architecture 

The architecture is based on decentralized peer-to-peer gateway interactions. As per the diagram below all gateways are peer managed by different organization and can be a client/service based on transaction flow. Gateway exposes high performance Thrift RPC API and communication between gateways will happens on RPC. RPC APIs are required to support single endpoint, inter-gateway trust and performance.

Communication between gateway and underpinning cloud happens on platform native protocol; as mentioned gateway follows pluggable design paradigm to communicate with underpinning cloud. 

The gateway also exposes REST APIs which is needed to support uniform REST API requirements, which makes it platform agnostic.

## Gateway Components

![Alliance Component Diagram](docs/_static/AllianceBlockDiagram.png)

The Gateway majorly have three components as below 

### Api Server

API server exposes uniform REST APIs and abstracts the complexity of many platform APIs. It introduce a new construct called cloud Namespace which is used addressing of request.

#### Admin API

Admin API are used to setup partners, metadata and PKI trust, these APIs are mostly used by cloud Admins. 

#### Management API

Management APIs are used for inter-cloud resource management which includes lookup, provisioning and de-provisioning of resources.  

[API Docs](https://github.com/CiscoCloud/alliance/tree/update_readme/apis)

### RPC Server

RPC server exposes Thrift APIs for inter-gateway communicate and provide trust based inter-cloud integration. Trust validation is happens with PKI and symmetric cryptography.   

### Asynchronous worker

TBD - Not implemented
